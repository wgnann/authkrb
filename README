authkrb Plugin for DokuWiki

Kerberos Ugly Auth Plugin



How to Install:

First, install php krb5 module. In a Debian system it can be done with these commands:

    $ apt install libtool-bin libkrb5-dev php-pear php-dev
    $ pecl install krb5

Then, you should configure PHP to use krb5.so module. Just insert the line

    extension=krb5.so

before the specific module configurations at php.ini.

At last, clone this repository to your Dokuwiki's plugin directory.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/authkrb/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!
